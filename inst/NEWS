CHANGES IN VERSION 1.16.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES
	cn2lr now has methods for vector, matrix, and DataFrame (of Rle) and 
	allows you to center your log2ratio values on 2 copies, or on a specified 
	'ploidy' for your sample.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

	The BAFSet and CNSet classes have moved from deprecated 
	to defunct. These classes only added getter/setter methods 
	for baf/lrr/cn. Since these only cover some possible 
	assayDataElements, it is better to use x[i,j,k], where k is 
	the name of an assayDataElement.
	
	All RangedData-related things have now progressed to defunct. Please use 
	GRanges for locData and everywhere else. Since the genoset package provides 
	a common API for GenoSet, GRanges, and RangedData, I hope this will be a 
	simple change for everyone.
	
	sampleNames and featureNames are now *un-deprecated*.  Feel free to use 
	them. They just call colnames and rownames, respectively. I have defined 
	my own rownames and colnames functions. The eSet ones seem to do a lot of 
	extra work, and the getter versions read from the first assayDataElement, 
	rather than pData and fData. I changed to the latter, so BigMatrix 
	assayDataElements will remain untouched until you really mean to access 
	them.
