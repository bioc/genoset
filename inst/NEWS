1.0.0 

Object creation at user level changed so that GenoSet, BAFSet, and CNSet functions all 
call an internal input checker and object generator function initGenoSet rather than having
 GenoSet() create all 3 objects using a "type" arg.

Segmentation functions now return DataFrame objects containing one Rle vector per sample. 
These give the same effect of having big matrices with repeated data matching the dimensions 
of the un-segmented data, but are considerably smaller.  For a dataset of ~1k SNP6 arrays, 
the data in the lrr matrix is about 0.8% of the size using this strategy. In all regards, 
these can be treated as just another matrix in assayData, but in special cases it is useful to 
take advantage of the data in its runValue and runLength form.

New methods defined for DataFrame to allow usage as assayData element:
    colMeans
    annotatedDataFrameFrom

Methods that get genome information from a GenoSet now work on RangedData too.  RangedData and 
GenoSet now share some API to make this easier. RangedData gets chr and pos, GenoSet gets names, 
ranges, and elementLengths. Now chrInfo, chrIndices, genoPos, etc. can work on either object type.

pos and genoPos now defined as floor of mean of start and end positions.

1.0.6
Substantial speed improvements for boundingIndices() and rangeSampleMeans.

1.1.7
Added loadGC function to get local GC content and version bump for bioC2.9

1.1.8
genomeOrder becomes toGenomeOrder which now takes and returns a GenoSet or RangedData rather than just returning the index to reorder such objects.  locData<- now reorders the whole GenoSet and assures that all of the featureNames match.

1.1.9
Added support for big.matrix objects from bigmemory as assayDataElements

1.1.10
***API Change*** list operator "[[" no longer used to subset by chromosome. It reverts back to extracting a column from pData like other eSets. chrIndices gains a "chr" argument that serves as a fast way to get the indices needed to subset rows by chromosome.

1.1.11
***API Addition*** "k" argument to "[" can be used to subset from a specific assayDataElement.  Numeric and character "k"s are allowed.  assayDataElement(ds,k)[i,j] is the same as ds[i,j,k], but "i" can be a RangedData or RangesList.

1.1.12
assayDataElements can be integer matrices with levels that will serve as factors for now.  Please see the help for convertToBigMatrix.

1.4.9
*** API Changes *** segTable on a DataFrame of Rle now has a "stack" argument to rbind the resulting list of data.frames of per-sample segments into on giant data.frame.  A "Sample" column will be added to separate samples.  The list of individual data.frames no longer has an "ID" column.  Also, some refactoring to speed up this method.

1.4.10
segTable for Rle now optionally takes chrIndices table, start and stop from locData for speed. segTable for DataFrame uses this trick. Much faster.  About 95% time reduction for a large dataset on a large chip.
