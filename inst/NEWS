1.0.0 

Object creation at user level changed so that GenoSet, BAFSet, and CNSet functions all 
call an internal input checker and object generator function initGenoSet rather than having
 GenoSet() create all 3 objects using a "type" arg.

Segmentation functions now return DataFrame objects containing one Rle vector per sample. 
These give the same effect of having big matrices with repeated data matching the dimensions 
of the un-segmented data, but are considerably smaller.  For a dataset of ~1k SNP6 arrays, 
the data in the lrr matrix is about 0.8% of the size using this strategy. In all regards, 
these can be treated as just another matrix in assayData, but in special cases it is useful to 
take advantage of the data in its runValue and runLength form.

New methods defined for DataFrame to allow usage as assayData element:
    colMeans
    annotatedDataFrameFrom

Methods that get genome information from a GenoSet now work on RangedData too.  RangedData and 
GenoSet now share some API to make this easier. RangedData gets chr and pos, GenoSet gets names, 
ranges, and elementLengths. Now chrInfo, chrIndices, genoPos, etc. can work on either object type.

pos and genoPos now defined as floor of mean of start and end positions.

1.0.6
Substantial speed improvements for boundingIndices() and rangeSampleMeans.
